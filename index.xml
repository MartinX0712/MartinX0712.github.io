            Many Chinese people now have an English name. My English name is Martin. Many people may be curious about the story behind my English name.
In fact, I chose Martin as my English name because I admire Martin Luther King a lot. In the first year of high school, I learned &amp;ldquo;I Have a Dream&amp;rdquo; in my English course. This speech was so inspiring that I began to learn more about this hero in the civil rights movement.
